# Quick Start

Start by downloading the latest STABLE or DEV version. Keep in mind that the DEV version has many unexpected bugs, but also fixes and imports new features, so it's you're choice

The Official Spigot Page for the plugin is [https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/tradeshop.32762/](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/tradeshop.32762/) (Stable Releases)

And the Github Page for the plugin is [https://github.com/TradeShop](https://github.com/TradeShop) (Dev Releases)

Feel free to join the discord anytime for any questions, comments, concerns

Once you have chosen your desired version, drag the .jar file on to your server's `plugin folder`

Restart the server after and open up the configuration file in `plugins/tradeshops`&#x20;

Configuration will be in another page, but for now, the plugin should be installed

(A permission plugin is highly recommended, for example, [Luck Perms](https://luckperms.net))

\*Check if you have the right version of the plugins for the right Minecraft server\*
